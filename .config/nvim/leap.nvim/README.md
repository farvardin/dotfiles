# leap.nvim

Leap is a general-purpose motion plugin for Neovim, building and improving
primarily on [vim-sneak](https://github.com/justinmk/vim-sneak), with the
ultimate goal of establishing a new standard interface for moving around in the
visible area in Vim-like modal editors. It allows you to reach any target in a
very fast, uniform way, and minimizes the required focus level while executing
a jump.

![showcase](../media/showcase.gif?raw=true)

### How to use it (TL;DR)

Leap's default motions allow you to jump to any positions in the visible editor
area by entering a 2-character search pattern, and then potentially a label
character to pick your target from multiple matches, in a manner similar to
Sneak. The main novel idea in Leap is that **you get a preview of the target
labels** - Leap shows you which key you will need to press before you actually
need to do that.

- Initiate the search in the forward (`s`) or backward (`S`) direction, or in
  the other windows (`gs`). (Note: you can use a single key for the current
  window or even the whole tab page, if you are okay with the trade-offs.)
- Start typing a 2-character pattern (`{char1}{char2}`).
- After typing the first character, you see "labels" appearing next to some of
  the `{char1}{?}` pairs. You cannot _use_ the labels yet.
- Enter `{char2}`. If the pair was not labeled, then voilà, you're already
  there. You can safely ignore the remaining labels - those are guaranteed
  non-conflicting letters, disappearing on the next keypress - and continue
  editing.
- Else: type the label character. If there are more matches than available
  labels, you can switch between groups, using `<space>` and `<tab>`. Labels in
  the immediate next group are already visible, but highlighted differently
  than the active ones.

Character pairs give you full coverage of the screen:

- `s{char}<space>` jumps to a character before the end of the line.
- `s<space><space>` jumps to any EOL position, including empty lines.

At any stage, `<enter>` consistently jumps to the next available target
(`<tab>` steps back):

- `s<enter>...` repeats the previous search.
- `s{char}<enter>...` can be used as a multiline substitute for `fFtT` motions.

### Why is this method cool?

It is ridiculously fast: not counting the trigger key, leaping to literally
anywhere on the screen rarely takes more than 3 keystrokes in total, that can be
typed in one go. Often 2 is enough.

At the same time, it reduces mental effort to almost zero:

- You _don't have to weigh alternatives_: a single universal motion type can be
  used in all non-trivial situations.

- You _don't have to compose in your head_: one command achieves one logical
  movement.

- You _don't have to be aware of the context_: the eyes can keep focusing on the
  target the whole time.

- You _don't have to make decisions on the fly_: the sequence you should enter
  is determined from the very beginning.

- You _don't have to pause in the middle_: if typing at a moderate speed, at
  each step you already know what the immediate next keypress should be, and
  your mind can process the rest in the background.

## Getting started

### Status

The plugin is not 100% stable yet, but don't let that stop you - the usage
basics are extremely unlikely to change. To follow breaking changes, subscribe
to the corresponding [issue](https://github.com/ggandor/leap.nvim/issues/18).

### Requirements

* Neovim >= 0.7.0 stable, or latest nightly

### Dependencies

* [repeat.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat), for dot-repeats (`.`) to
  work

### Installation

Use your preferred method or plugin manager. No extra steps needed besides
defining keybindings - to use the default ones, put the following into your
config (overrides `s`, `S` and `gs` in all modes):

`require('leap').create_default_mappings()` (init.lua)

`lua require('leap').create_default_mappings()` (init.vim)

<details>
<summary>Alternative key mappings</summary>

Calling `require('leap').create_default_mappings()` is equivalent to:

```lua
vim.keymap.set({'n', 'x', 'o'}, 's',  '<Plug>(leap-forward)')
vim.keymap.set({'n', 'x', 'o'}, 'S',  '<Plug>(leap-backward)')
vim.keymap.set({'n', 'x', 'o'}, 'gs', '<Plug>(leap-from-window)')
```

A suggested alternative arrangement (bidirectional `s` for Normal mode):

```lua
vim.keymap.set('n',        's', '<Plug>(leap)')
vim.keymap.set('n',        'S', '<Plug>(leap-from-window)')
vim.keymap.set({'x', 'o'}, 's', '<Plug>(leap-forward)')
vim.keymap.set({'x', 'o'}, 'S', '<Plug>(leap-backward)')
```

`<Plug>(leap)` sorts matches by euclidean (beeline) distance from the cursor,
with the exception that the current line, and on the current line, forward
direction is prioritized. That is, you can always be sure that the targets
right in front of you will be the first ones.

Note that you will get twice as many targets and thus half as many autojumps on
average, but not needing to press the Shift key for backward motions might
compensate for that. Another caveat is that you cannot traverse through the
matches (`:h leap-traversal`), although invoking repeat right away (`:h
leap-repeat`) can substitute for that.

Mapping to `<Plug>(leap)` is not recommended for Visual mode, as autojumping in
a random direction might be too disorienting with the selection highlight on,
and neither for Operator-pending mode, as dot-repeat cannot be used if the
search is non-directional.

For further customization, see `:h leap-custom-mappings`.

<summary>Suggested additional tweaks</summary>

```lua

-- the default whitespace group.
require('leap').opts.equivalence_classes = { ' \t\r\n', '([{', ')]}', '\'"`' }

-- Override some old defaults - use backspace instead of tab (see issue #165).
require('leap').opts.special_keys.prev_target = '<backspace>'
require('leap').opts.special_keys.prev_group = '<backspace>'

-- Use the traversal keys to repeat the previous motion without explicitly
-- invoking Leap.
require('leap.user').set_repeat_keys('<enter>', '<backspace>')
```

<summary>Workaround for the duplicate cursor bug when autojumping</summary>

For Neovim versions < 0.10 (https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/20793):

```lua

vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('User', { pattern = 'LeapEnter',
    callback = function()
      vim.cmd.hi('Cursor', 'blend=100')
      vim.opt.guicursor:append { 'a:Cursor/lCursor' }
    end,
  }
)
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('User', { pattern = 'LeapLeave',
    callback = function()
      vim.cmd.hi('Cursor', 'blend=0')
      vim.opt.guicursor:remove { 'a:Cursor/lCursor' }
    end,
  }

<details>
<summary>Lazy loading</summary>

...is all the rage now, but doing it via your plugin manager is unnecessary, as
Leap lazy loads itself. Using the `keys` feature of lazy.nvim might even cause
[problems](https://github.com/ggandor/leap.nvim/issues/191).

</details>

### Next steps

Help files are not exactly page-turners, but `:h leap` is, dare I say, not that
dry a read - I suggest at least skimming it, even if you don't have a specific
question yet (if nothing else: `:h leap-usage`, `:h leap-config`, `:h
leap-events`). While Leap has deeply thought-through, opinionated defaults, its
small(ish) but comprehensive API makes it pretty flexible.

## Design considerations in detail

### The ideal

Premise: jumping from point A to B on the screen should not be some [exciting
puzzle](https://www.vimgolf.com/), for which you should train yourself; it
should be a non-issue. An ideal keyboard-driven interface would impose almost no
more cognitive burden than using a mouse, without the constant context-switching
required by the latter.

That is, **you do not want to think about**

- **the command**: we need one fundamental targeting method that can bring you
  anywhere: a "jetpack on the back", instead of "airline routes" (↔
  [EasyMotion](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion) and its
  derivatives)
- **the context**: it should be enough to look at the target, and nothing else
  (↔ vanilla Vim motion combinations using relative line numbers and/or
  repeats)
- **the steps**: the motion should be atomic (↔ Vim motion combos), and ideally
  you should be able to type the whole sequence in one go, on more or less
  autopilot (↔ any kind of "just-in-time" labeling method; note that the
  "search command on steroids" approach by
  [Pounce](https://github.com/rlane/pounce.nvim) and
  [Flash](https://github.com/folke/flash.nvim), where the pattern length is not
  fixed, and thus the labels appear at an unknown time, makes this last goal
  impossible)

All the while using **as few keystrokes as possible**, and getting distracted by
**as little incidental visual noise as possible**.

### How do we measure up?

It is obviously impossible to achieve all of the above at the same time, without
some trade-offs at least; but in our opinion Leap comes pretty close, occupying
a sweet spot in the design space. (The worst remaining offender might be visual
noise.)

The **one-step shift between perception and action** is the big idea that cuts
the Gordian knot: a fixed pattern length combined with ahead-of-time labeling
can eliminate the surprise factor from the search-based method (which is the
only viable approach - see "jetpack" above). Fortunately, a 2-character pattern
\- the shortest one with which we can play this trick - is also long enough to
sufficiently narrow down the matches in the vast majority of cases.

Fixed pattern length also makes **(safe) automatic jump to the first target**
possible. You cannot improve on jumping directly, just like how `f` and `t`
works, not having to read a label at all, and not having to accept the match
with `<enter>` either. However, we can do this in a smart way: if there are
many targets (more than 15-20), we stay put, so we can use a bigger, "unsafe"
label set - getting the best of both worlds. The non-determinism we're
introducing is less of an issue here, since the outcome is known in advance.

In sum, compared to other methods based on labeling targets, Leap's approach is
unique in that it

* offers a smoother experience, by (somewhat) eliminating the pause before
  typing the label

* feels natural to use for both distant _and_ close targets

### Auxiliary principles

<details>
<summary>Optimize for the common case</summary>

A good example is using strictly one-character labels and switching between
groups, which can become awkward beyond, say, 200 targets, but makes a whole
bunch of edge cases and UI problems nonexistent.

### Defaults

<details>
<summary>Why remap `s`/`S`?</summary>

Common operations should use the fewest keystrokes and the most comfortable
keys, so it makes sense to take those over by Leap, especially given that both
native commands have synonyms:

Normal mode

- `s` = `cl` (or `xi`)
- `S` = `cc`

Visual mode

- `s` = `c`
- `S` = `Vc`, or `c` if already in linewise mode

If you are not convinced, just head to `:h leap-custom-mappings`.

</details>

### Features

<details>
<summary>Search in all windows</summary>

```lua
vim.keymap.set('n', 's', function ()
  require('leap').leap {
    target_windows = require('leap.user').get_focusable_windows()
  }
end)
```

The additional trade-off here is that if you have multiple windows open on the
tab page, then you will almost never get an autojump, except if all targets are
in the same window (it would be too disorienting if the cursor could suddenly
jump in/to a different window than your goal, right before selecting the
target, not to mention that we don't want to change the state of a window we're
not targeting).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Smart case sensitivity, wildcard characters (one-way
aliases)</summary>

Ahead-of-time labeling, unfortunately, makes them impossible, by design: for a
potential match in phase one, we might need to show two different labels
(corresponding to two different futures) at the same time.

### Configuration

<details>
<summary>Disable auto-jumping to the first match</summary>

```lua
require('leap').opts.safe_labels = {}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Greying out the search area</summary>

```lua
-- Or just set to grey directly, e.g. { fg = '#777777' },
-- if Comment is saturated.
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, 'LeapBackdrop', { link = 'Comment' })
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Hiding secondary labels</summary>

You can hide the letters, and show emtpy boxes by tweaking the
`LeapLabelSecondary` highlight group (that way you keep a visual indication
that the target is labeled):

```lua
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('ColorScheme', {
  callback = function ()
    local bg = vim.api.nvim_get_hl(0, {name = 'LeapLabelSecondary'}).bg
    vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, 'LeapLabelSecondary',{ fg = bg, bg = bg, })
  end
})
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Lightspeed-style highlighting</summary>

```lua
-- The below settings make Leap's highlighting closer to what you've been
-- used to in Lightspeed.

vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, 'LeapBackdrop', { link = 'Comment' }) -- or some grey
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, 'LeapMatch', {
  -- For light themes, set to 'black' or similar.
  fg = 'white', bold = true, nocombine = true,
})

-- Lightspeed colors
-- primary labels: bg = "#f02077" (light theme) or "#ff2f87"  (dark theme)
-- secondary labels: bg = "#399d9f" (light theme) or "#99ddff" (dark theme)
-- shortcuts: bg = "#f00077", fg = "white"
-- You might want to use either the primary label or the shortcut colors
-- for Leap primary labels, depending on your taste.
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, 'LeapLabelPrimary', {
  fg = 'red', bold = true, nocombine = true,
})
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, 'LeapLabelSecondary', {
  fg = 'blue', bold = true, nocombine = true,
})
-- Try it without this setting first, you might find you don't even miss it.
require('leap').opts.highlight_unlabeled_phase_one_targets = true
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Working with non-English text</summary>

Check out `opts.equivalence_classes`. For example, you can group accented
vowels together: `{ 'aá', 'eé', 'ií', ... }`.

</details>

### Miscellaneous

<details>
<summary>Was the name inspired by Jef Raskin's Leap?</summary>

To paraphrase Steve Jobs about their logo and Turing's poison apple, I wish it
were, but it is a coincidence. "Leap" is just another synonym for "jump", that
happens to rhyme with Sneak. That said, in some respects you can indeed think
of leap.nvim as a spiritual successor to Raskin's work, and thus the name as a
little tribute to the great pioneer of interface design, even though embracing
the modal paradigm is a fundamental difference in our approach.

</details>

## Extending Leap

There is more to Leap than meets the eye. On a general level, you should think
of it as less of a motion plugin and more of an engine for selecting visible
targets on the screen (acquired by arbitrary means), and doing arbitrary things
with them. See `:h leap.leap()` and `:h leap-events`.

There are lots of ways you can extend the plugin and bend it to your will, and
the combinations of them give you almost infinite possibilities. Some practical
examples:

<details>
<summary>Linewise motions</summary>

```lua
local function get_line_starts(winid, skip_range)
  local wininfo =  vim.fn.getwininfo(winid)[1]
  local cur_line = vim.fn.line('.')
  -- Skip lines close to the cursor.
  local skip_range = skip_range or 2

  -- Get targets.
  local targets = {}
  local lnum = wininfo.topline
  while lnum <= wininfo.botline do
    local fold_end = vim.fn.foldclosedend(lnum)
    -- Skip folded ranges.
    if fold_end ~= -1 then
      lnum = fold_end + 1
    else
      if (lnum < cur_line - skip_range) or (lnum > cur_line + skip_range) then
        table.insert(targets, { pos = { lnum, 1 } })
      end
      lnum = lnum + 1
    end
  end

  -- Sort them by vertical screen distance from cursor.
  local cur_screen_row = vim.fn.screenpos(winid, cur_line, 1)['row']
  local function screen_rows_from_cur(t)
    local t_screen_row = vim.fn.screenpos(winid, t.pos[1], t.pos[2])['row']
    return math.abs(cur_screen_row - t_screen_row)
  end
  table.sort(targets, function (t1, t2)
    return screen_rows_from_cur(t1) < screen_rows_from_cur(t2)
  end)

  if #targets >= 1 then
    return targets
  end
end

-- You can pass an argument to specify a range to be skipped
-- before/after the cursor (default is +/-2).
function leap_line_start(skip_range)
  local winid = vim.api.nvim_get_current_win()
  require('leap').leap {
    target_windows = { winid },
    targets = get_line_starts(winid, skip_range),
  }
end

-- For maximum comfort, force linewise selection in the mappings:
vim.keymap.set('x', '|', function ()
  -- Only force V if not already in it (otherwise it would exit Visual mode).
  if vim.fn.mode(1) ~= 'V' then vim.cmd('normal! V') end
  leap_line_start()
end)
vim.keymap.set('o', '|', "V<cmd>lua leap_line_start()<cr>")
```
