# This is a sample .dgenrc file (Megadrive / Genesis emulator)
#
# It simply sets everything to their default values
# Lines that BEGIN with a hash (#) (i.e. NOTHING before it) are comments.
# Also, everything after the "field = value" is ignored (but don't count on it)

# Note that your own RC file doesn't need to include every field like this
# one does, any ones you exclude simply have their compiled-in default values.

# Also, you can have multiple RC files, and use the -r option to dgen
# to pick the rc you want to load.

# Fields beginning with "key_" take key names. The valid key names are listed
# in the dgenrc(5) manpage.

# Fields beginning with "bool_" are boolean, i.e. they take a true or false
# value:
#  "true", "yes", any number except 0: true 
#  "false", "no", "0"                : false

# Fields beginning with "int_" take a _positive_ integer. Simple enough, huh? ;)

# The syntax and fields of this file are documented in a bit more detail in the
# dgenrc(5) manpage.

# These are the joypad mappings for both controllers.  Defaults are
# tailored for Gravis GamePad Pros. (10 button)  Configure the variables:
# joypadX_bY, where X is the joypad number (1 or 2) and Y is the
# corresponding button.  It may take some tweaking to get the values just
# right.  You can define up to 16 buttons (0-15) and can define Genesis
# buttons more than once and can leave them blank.  Acceptable identifiers
# are:
# A, a, B, b, C, c, X, x, Y, y, Z, z, MODE, mode, M, m, START, start, S, s

# NOTE:  For now, you have to uncomment the buttons you are using, or the
# default mappings will be used.  You will get warnings about invalid RC
# lines if you don't compile joystick support in. [PKH]
